# InTouch
A social media platform that allows users to post pictures with captions, like posts, and follow other users whose content they wish to view.

### Premise
InTouch was built with the intent of providing a social media app that allows users to stay in touch with the people of their choosing, without anyone else being able to find their profile. The way that InTouch enforces this is by providing no way, such as searching, to find other users unless they personally provide the link to their profile. As long as a user chooses a unique username that no one is likely to guess, similar to the way one chooses a password, then only people that they share their profile link with will be able to stay in touch with them.

### Features

### Technologies
InTouch is a full stack web application that runs on the MERN stack. This means any data that the application stores is stored in a MongoDB database, the backend server is implemented using the Express framework, the runtime environment that the server runs on is Node.js, and the frontend is built using the React framework. The backend server adheres to RESTful API principles, and the frontend utilizes the React Context API to keep track of the currently logged in user. The application is deployed to the cloud using Heroku.


### How do I get InTouch?

If you would like to see what the app looks like for a user who is following and is followed by many other users, you can use the login sofie@gmail.com and password 123456. If you would like to test out the features that make changes to a profile such as changing the username, email, password, or deleting an account, please register your own account to do so.
